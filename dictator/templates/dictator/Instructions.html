<p>{% trans "This last task involves <strong>two participants</strong> – Participant A and Participant B." %}</p>
<p>{% trans "Remember, the other participant is different from the ones you interacted with in the previous two tasks." %}</p>
<p>{% trans "These are the rules:" %}</p>
<ul>
  <li>{% blocktrans %}At the beginning, Participant A receives {{amount}}.{% endblocktrans %}</li>
  <li>{% blocktrans %}Participant B does not receive any money — he or she has 0.{% endblocktrans %}</li>
  <li>{% blocktrans %}Participant A must now decide if he or she wants to transfer any of his or her {{amount}} to Participant B.{% endblocktrans %}</li>
  <li>{% blocktrans %}This transfer is not multiplied by any number and Participant B cannot transfer any amount back to Participant A.{% endblocktrans %}</li>
</ul>
<p>Your role as Participant A or B will be determined later. We ask you to make a choice as A in case this is your role. B has no decision to make. Remember that someone will be assigned to role B and that person's payment will be affected by your decision as A.{% endblocktrans %}</p>
<p><strong>{% blocktrans %}Because this task is simple, there will be no simulator to test out different choices.{% endblocktrans %}</strong></p>
