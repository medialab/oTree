<h1>Words Task</h1>
<hr/>
<div class="hidden-sm hidden-xs">
  <p>Now, put your middle or index fingers on the <strong>E</strong> and <strong>I</strong> keys of your keyboard. In this part of the study, words representing categories will appear one-by-one in the middle of the screen. Two labels at the top will tell you which words go with each key.</p>
  <p>When the item belongs to a category on the left, press the E key; when the item belongs to a category on the right, press the I key. Each word has an easy correct classification and belongs to only one category. If you make an error, an X will appear â€“ fix the error by hitting the other key.</p>
  <p>A few rules to remember:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Keep your index fingers on the 'e' and 'i' keys to enable rapid response.</li>
    <li>The test gives no results if you go slow -- Please try to go as fast as possible.</li>
    <li>Expect to make a few mistakes because of going fast. That's OK.</li>
    <li>For best results, avoid distractions and stay focused.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Press the space bar to begin.</h3>
