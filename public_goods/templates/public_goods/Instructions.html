<p>
    In this study, you will be in a randomly formed group of {{ Constants.players_per_group }} participants. Each participant in the group is given {{ Constants.endowment }}. The group
    has the opportunity to undertake a joint project. Each participant in the group decides how much she or he is going to contribute to
    the project. Contribution could be any integer from 0 to {{ Constants.endowment }}.
</p>
<p>
    The earnings from the project are calculated as follows: The contributions of all {{ Constants.players_per_group }} participants are added up, the total contribution
    is multiplied by a factor of {{ Constants.efficiency_factor }}, and the resulting amount is the total earnings from the project, which is evenly split among all {{ Constants.players_per_group }}
    participants. Your payoff equals your earnings from the project, plus the amount you did not contribute.
</p>

For your convenience, these instructions will remain available to you on all subsequent screens of this study.
