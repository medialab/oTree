Animated simulations
====================

#### Setup
Each animation lies in its own subdirectory, with the usable result being place in an `output` subfolder.
Inspect the HTML files and respect the code and instructions they provide.

#### About the optional setup
Animations may come with optional `data-attributes` to change content pseudo-dynamically without having to touch the source file.
Refer to README files in each source directories.

#### MORE INFO IN WIKI (soon)
